# GPT Image (ChatGPT Images web)

This is an **explicit command-only** capability: `/omg:gpt-image <prompt>`. It uses the user's logged-in ChatGPT subscription through a local Chromium CDP session and only `https://chatgpt.com/images/`. It has no API, backend, generic-chat plus-menu, browser launch, auto-login, or dependency-install fallback.

The prompt is sent to the external ChatGPT service. Treat it as an upload/privacy boundary: do not submit secrets, private source, credentials, or material the user may not send to OpenAI. A user must manually maintain a dedicated logged-in browser profile. Do not run `/omg:insane-review` or any other CDP automation concurrently.

## Resolve the engine

Resolve the exact non-symlink engine from the current suite-root binding. Do not select a plugin
cache glob or an old-identity binding for this new capability.

```bash
GI="$(python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import os
import stat
import sys

cwd = Path.cwd()
home = Path.home()
asset = Path("bin/gpt_image_web.py")
bindings = [
    cwd / ".gjc/runtimes/oh-my-gajae-code/root",
    home / ".gjc/agent/runtimes/oh-my-gajae-code/root",
]

for binding in bindings:
    try:
        info = binding.lstat()
        if binding.is_symlink() or not stat.S_ISREG(info.st_mode) or stat.S_IMODE(info.st_mode) & 0o077:
            continue
        lines = binding.read_text(encoding="utf-8").splitlines()
        if len(lines) != 1 or not os.path.isabs(lines[0]) or any(ord(ch) < 32 for ch in lines[0]):
            continue
        root = Path(lines[0])
        canonical = root.resolve(strict=True)
        if str(root) != str(canonical):
            continue
        candidate = canonical / asset
        if candidate.is_symlink() or not candidate.is_file():
            continue
        print(candidate)
        raise SystemExit(0)
    except (OSError, UnicodeError):
        continue

checkout = cwd / "plugins/oh-my-gajae-code" / asset
try:
    if not checkout.is_symlink() and checkout.is_file():
        print(checkout.resolve(strict=True))
        raise SystemExit(0)
except OSError:
    pass

print("gpt-image engine not found; rerun the hardened OMG installer", file=sys.stderr)
raise SystemExit(1)
PY
)" || exit 1
```

## Procedure

1. Require a nonempty exact prompt. Clarify it before executing; do not silently embellish it.
2. Resolve `$GI` with the hardened binding resolver and run the read-only prerequisite check:
   ```bash
   python3 "$GI" --check-env
   ```
   It requires POSIX deadline enforcement, Python Playwright, and a real local Chrome/Chromium CDP endpoint. It also requires the endpoint to be proven bound to the dedicated profile — via the listener process's `--user-data-dir` argv (Chrome 136+, which no longer writes a receipt) or the legacy `DevToolsActivePort` receipt when present. The user must manually start/login the dedicated browser; do not install, launch, or log in for them.
3. Generate only after a successful check:
   ```bash
   python3 "$GI" --output-dir .gpt-image -- "$ARGUMENTS"
   ```
4. Report the emitted PNG path and its adjacent provenance JSON. The engine uses the Images composer, exact prompt, a fresh conversation, one completed new assistant image, and the Images fullscreen **Save** action. It rejects ambiguous assets and never downloads a thumbnail, screenshot, signed URL, or backend response.

ChatGPT currently exposes the fullscreen Save/Download control behind the selected image's
share-labeled viewer action. Opening that viewer is allowed only to reach the original download;
never click Copy link, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, or any other publication control.

Output is atomically/exclusively written to the current project's non-symlink `.gpt-image/` directory (0700); PNG and provenance files are 0600. Provenance includes prompt, conversation URL, SHA-256, size, dimensions, timestamp, and route, never cookies or signed asset URLs. Failures remove temporary downloads and partial output.
